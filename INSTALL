How to build uim

(See https://github.com/uim/uim/wiki/InstallUim for details)

Requirements
============
The requirements for building uim is listed below.

    * gcc
    * GNU make
    * iconv(3)
    * gettext
    * intltool

Compilation
===========

First, please extract source from tar ball.

      $ tar xvjf uim-x.x.x.tar.bz2

Then, move to the extracted directory and run configure.

      $ cd uim-x.x.x
      $ ./configure 

Finally, make and install it.

      $ make
      $ su
      $ sudo make install

By default, uim is installed under /usr/local , but this directory may
not be on the system search path. Should that be the case, add the
line /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.conf and then, run ldconfig.
