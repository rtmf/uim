Environment variables for uim
=============================

libuim accepts some enviroment variables mainly for debugging purpose.


- LIBUIM_USER_SCM_FILE

  This variable takes a file path as a value. If this variable is
  defined, uim reads the file as user customization file instead of
  ~/.uim

- LIBUIM_SCM_FILES

  This variable takes a colon-separated list of directories. If this
  variable is defined, uim add the values to the search path of .scm
  files.

- LIBUIM_SYSTEM_SCM_FILES

  This variable takes a directory path as a value. If this variable is
  defined, uim add the value to the search path of .scm files provided
  by underlying Scheme interpreter (i.e. SigScheme libraries).

- LIBUIM_PLUGIN_LIB_DIR

  This variable takes a directory path as a value. If this variable is
  defined, uim add the value to the search path of plugin files.

- LIBUIM_VERBOSE

  This variable takes a number as a value. 0-10 can be specified. If
  LIBUIM_VERBOSE is greater than or equal to 5, uim shows backtrace
  when error occurred if --enable-backtrace is set by configure.

- LIBUIM_VANILLA

  This variable takes an integer value. uim changes its behavior as
  follows if variable is defined.

  * LIBUIM_VANILLA=2 : vanilla + toppings

    Disable ~/.uim, user customs and lazy loading, but enable loading
    modules.

  * LIBUIM_VANILLA=1 : pure vanilla

    Disable ~/.uim, user customs, lazy loading, loading modules.

  * undefined : fully flavored

    Enable ~/.uim, user customs, lazy loading if required, and loading
    modules.

- LIBUIM_ENABLE_EMERGENCY_KEY

  If this variable is set to 1, the 'emergency key' to toggle these 2
  modes is enabled.

  * Normal mode

    Key inputs are processed by uim.

  * Emergency mode

    Key inputs are bypassed to application without being processed by uim.

  The emergency key is currently hardcoded to "<Shift>backspace".

- UIM_IM_ENGINE

  This obsolete variable takes an input method name as a value. The
  specified IM is selected as default IM. This variable is purely
  provided for debugging purpose and takes effect if and only if
  --enable-debug option is specified at configure time. The term 'IM
  engine' is not appropriate for current uim design.
