Notes for Packagers and System Integrators
------------------------------------------

  - The option "--enable-debug" and/or "--enable-backtrace" makes uim (in
    accurately, underlying SigScheme interpreter) quite heavy. Please keep them
    unspecified for normal library

  - Use the bundled SigScheme, and do not depend on external SigScheme
    package. Since the SigScheme interpreter is completely embedded into
    libuim without linking to libsscm, and exposing no SigScheme-specific
    symbols regardless of environment-dependent symbol exportation control
    existence such as -export-symbols of libtool or version script of ld,
    no conflict with libsscm occurs

  - libuim links to libgcroots although SigScheme is embedded into
    libuim. Although libgcroots is also bundled in uim, it should be
    managed as a separated package since both libsscm and libuim which
    provided by separated package depends on it. Add
    '--with-libgcroots=installed' to configure options for uim to disable
    build and install of the bundled version of libgcroots


Roadmap
-------

  - uim 1.9.0 and later

    The time for drastic reconstruction. Many user-visible changes.

    The composer framework will be introduced for extensible IM
    development.


  - uim 2.0.0

    Overall uim API will be revised.
